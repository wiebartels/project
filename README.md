# project description:
This is a practice project for the Data Science Toolbox course. It was used to practice file naming and project organization. 
The files in the folders are a copy of the files originally coming from this repository:  https://github.com/yuliaUU/files_to_copy
Note that the folder structure and file names have been changed to meet best practices.

The following folders are in this project:
-data (containing project data)
-docs (containing two subfolders)
  -weekly meetings (contains meeting minute documents)
  -Documents (contains reports as word documents)
-images (contains images generated in analysis)
-reports (contains a jupyter notebook version of the report)
-src (contains code to generate data and analyze it)
